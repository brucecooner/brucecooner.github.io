					<h2><a href="https://github.com/brucecooner/EarthSlicer" target="_blank" title="code on github">Earth Slicer</a></h2>
					<span class="codeTypeClass">Python</span><br>
					<p>
					This project grew from my frustrations trying to make topographical models using the previous project (FLT to Topo, see below).
					A top down topograpical model can require a lot of individual pieces, which all have to be correctly positioned.<br><br>
					So I turned the problem on its side and instead of tracing isolines, I traced elevation along vertical "slices" of earth,
					which then just get stacked next to each other to create the model.  This reduced registration (correct placement) to a one dimensional problem.<br>
					<br>
					For this project I switched from C# to Python, but the biggest functional change was using the USGS elevation point query
					service to get elevations instead of downloading large datasets, which greatly simplified the workflow.<br>
					I quickly found however that querying the elevations serially was too slow, so I refactored the query code to issue parallel queries. 
					Another optimization was to cache returned elevations in a local text file, so running a job second and multiple times did not 
					even need to query the server.<br>
					This app was written to output the slices in svg files ready to load and use in the laser cutter without requiring any further workflow steps.
					<br>
					This has made for some interesting physical models, which might become the base for more projects.
					<br>
					</p>
					<p>Here's an inset of one of the svg images produced by EarthSlicer:</p>
					<a href=".\assets\es6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="assets\es6.jpg" width="33%"/></a>
					<p>The image shows tat the app sends multiple slices to a single svg file, in a grid layout with a configurable size.<br>
					This grid output greatly reduces the number of individual files needed for a project.<br>
					Also note the index number on each slice, so you can easily place them in the right order, and the direction arrow to relay slice orientation.</p>
					<br>
					<p>These pictures show the first physical model to come from this project, Mt. Ord in the Mazatzal Mountains of Arizona, which has always been one of my favorite peaks.
					This model represents an approximately 6 by 4 mile section of earth, at a scale of around 0.45 miles per inch.<br>
					This model's vertical scale is 1.0, which means this is a scale-accurate representation of the mountain's terrain!<br>
					It was intensely pleasing to see this mini-mountain take shape as I glued the layers together.</p>
					<a href=".\assets\es4.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="assets\es4.jpg" width="100"/></a>
					<a href=".\assets\es5.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="assets\es5.jpg" width="100"/></a>
					<p>For the second model, I wanted to reproduce the entire Sierra Estrella range, which rises just south of my home in Goodyear, Arizona.<br>
					I also decided to try a something different, and added an option to the EarthSlicer to skip slices. I then
					coded a parametrically driven tool to produce notched bars, which would become ribs beneath the model to hold it together.<br>
					This model encompassed a much larger patch of earth, and I had to exaggerate the vertical scale to 1.75 or else the mountains would have
					been only one inch high at the highest point.<br>
					The results were pretty fantastic, and exactly what I wanted. I was debating a wall hanging piece on this theme, but
					unfortunately the details of the topography disappear when viewed from above, as it would be hanging on a wall.
					So I'm debating use of clay or other media to turn this into a solid model.</p>

					<p>In all I'm very pleased with this project, and it is still under active development to support more creative ideas!</p>

					<h2><a href="https://github.com/brucecooner/FLTTopo" target="_blank" title="code on github">FLT to topo</a></h2>
					<span class="codeTypeClass">C#</span>
					<p>
					FLTToTopo was my first attempt at topographical exploration in software.<br>
					After acquiring a laser cutter, my fascination with geomorphology led me to want to make topographical maps.
					For this to work with varying thickness of materials, I needed contour maps with the isolines at arbitrary 
					elevations that aren't necessarily multiples of ten.<br>
					I discovered I could download FLT/HDR format height maps from the USGS, so I wrote an application that could read
					these files and produce my arbitrarily contoured maps. I enjoyed breaking the problem down into smaller chunks of
					functionality, but my favorite part of this experience was using parallelism to massively decrease the time required to 
					create the output data.<br>
					While this program did what I intended it to do, unfortunately I found creating contour maps in physical form to be unwieldy
					due to the large number of individual pieces the process produced.  Also, downloading and managing the data was cumberson, and being 
					forced to work with data which never crossed a one degree boundary quickly became limiting.
					So while the software did what I had designed it to do, I abandoned this project and started the Earth Slicer project to make working with 
					topographical data easiser.<br>
					Below are a couple of output images produced by the FLTTopo program.

					<h2><a href="mandalaWIP\mandala.html " target="_blank" title="launch">mandala creator</a></h2>
					<span class="codeTypeClass">HTML/Javascript</span>
					<p>I had so much fun playing with the spokes maker that I created a drawing app completely focused on radial symmetry.<br>
					With it you draw lines (straight or freeform), circles, or curves onto a bunch of radial slices of a canvas, and you can 
					increase the number of to draw a whole lot of elements in a hurry.<br>
					I had more things in mind for this project but I got distracted and set it aside. It still wound up as something that's
					a lot of fun to play with though.<br>
					It's purely javascript, running in the browser, making extensive use of vector graphics.<br>
					Aspects of this project I particularly enjoyed were using object oriented design and classes to support the different drawing modes through a 
					common interface, and figuring out how to create the snap-to system.<br>

					<h2><a href="circles\circle_layout.html" target="_blank" title="launch">parametric circles</a></h2>
					<span class="codeTypeClass">HTML/Javascript</span>
					<p>I was pretty obsessed with radial symmetry for a while, and made yet another toy along that theme.<br>
					This one however focused on laying out a bunch of circles along a set of spokes, with parametric controls to change
					the layout dynamically.
					Again, I had more ideas for this project but got distracted. I was planning to expand the number of element types beyond
					just circles, and it obviously needed a lot more instruction and feedback for ease of use.
					This is another javascript project that runs in the browser. I made sure this project can export to svg format.
					One unexpectedly fun aspect of this one was creating a color selection wheel for changing the stroke/fill colors.  It was not
					easy to accomplish but a lot of fun.
					Being parametric in nature, I was also able to add save/restore feature through local browser storage, which is pretty neat.<br>
					I did actually use this tool to export some circular art that went into a physical product made on my laser cutter.<br>

					<h2><a href="https://github.com/brucecooner/brucecooner.github.io" target="_blank" title="code on github">this website</a></h2>
					<span class="codeTypeClass">HTML/CSS/Javascript</span>
					<p>I wrote this website.<br>
					I found out that github hosts static sites freely for a user account, and decided that this is where I'd park mine.<br>
					But it was also an exercise in creating a website from raw HTML without the use of frameworks (maybe some jquery).<br>
					After deciding on a three column layout, I originally implemented it in flex. This took some effort, and worked okay. 
					Recently however I've gone back and refactored it to use grid layout, a simpler way to achieve complex layouts
					(though flex still has its place).<br>
					Do not assume, however, that I'm sort of layout wizard. I still have to look up about anything new or different I
					go to do in html, and the interactions of CSS' various attributes can still be a mystery to me.<br>
					Looking at its early internet, programmer-art aesthetics will tell you that web design isn't my forte, but I still think it gets the point across.</p>

					<h2><a href="spokes.html" target="_blank" title="launch">spokes maker</a></h2>
					<span class="codeTypeClass">HTML/CSS</span><br>
					<p>I was working on physical projects where there was a constant need to print out a template with N radially arranged
					spokes for use as a stencil or template, but I didn't have an art program at the time that let me easily create one.
					So I made this quick little spoke generator.
					The fun part here was using only html and CSS to generate simple graphics.<br>
					Sample output:<br></p>

					<h2><a href="https://github.com/brucecooner/GF_scrapers" target="_blank" title="code on github">Glowforge dashboard job scraper</a></h2>
					<span class="codeTypeClass">Javascript</span>
					<p>
					If you've owned a Glowforge laser cutter for any length of time, you know that the dashboard where you select a print job
					will eventually become a huge list dozens of pages long.<br>
					For the longest time, the dashboard offered no way to search this list, which led to endless scrolling to find anything
					you'd printed more than a few weeks before.<br>
					Each of these print jobs has a unique url, meaning you can visit them directly if you have the address, which gave me an idea...<br>
					<br>
					My reponse was to create a javascript module that you add to the dashboard page (via the browser debug console) which
					hooks the scroll event and scrapes jobs and their urls as you scroll the page.<br>
					After scrolling through your job list, you return to the debugger and call a function in my module to
					list all of the jobs it has discovered in a tabular form, that you can copy from the console, then paste directly into a spreadsheet.<br>
					I will regularly scrape all of the jobs in my dashboard and drop it into a sheet so I have a full and fully visible
					searchable list of all my print jobs.<br>
					Glowforge has since added a search bar to the dashboard, which helps, but it's sometimes more useful to have a single page view
					of my entire jobs list.
