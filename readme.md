Code for my personal website, hosted right here on github.

I wrote this without the use of frameworks, in raw HTML and CSS, like a madman.

Sure, maybe I am partially insane, but I wanted an exercise that would teach me some things about
how sites work closer to the browser.  Thus there's a little ajax, a little animated CSS, some dynamic
generation, etc.
