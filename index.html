					<p>The projects in my repo usually support some creative idea.<br>
					They may come about to explore visual art, or to support the creation of a physical object.<br>
					One thing I've discovered from this is that using software I wrote to help create a physical product that I can hold in my hands is very rewarding.<br>
					I've detailed most of my personal projects here.<br>
					They span a number of languages I've worked in, and there are links to the repo page for each.<br>
					These should illustrate how I approach programming problems, trying to break a large job down into self contained pieces.

					<h2><a href="https://github.com/brucecooner/EarthSlicer" target="_blank">Earth Slicer</a></h2>
					<span class="codeTypeClass">Python</span><br>
					<p>
					This project grew from my frustrations trying to make topographical models using the previous project (FLT to Topo).
					A top down topograpical model can require a lot of individual pieces, which have to be individually tracked and
					correctly placed.<br><br>
					So I turned the problem on its side and instead of tracing isolines, I traced elevations along vertical "slices" of earth,
					which just get placed next to each other to create the model.  This reduced the placement/registration to a one dimensional problem.<br>
					<br>
					For this project I switched from C# to Python, but the biggest functional change was using the USGS point height query
					service to get elevations instead of downloading large datasets, which greatly simplified the workflow.<br>
					I quickly found however that querying the elevations serially was too slow, so I refactored the query code to issue parallel queries. 
					Another optimization was to cache returned elevations in a local text file, that way running the same jobs again did not 
					even need to query the server.<br>
					This app was written to output the slices in svg files ready to load and use in the laser cutter without requiring any further workflow steps.
					<br>
					This has made for some interesting physical models, but I'm still thinking about how to use these results in an artistic way.
					They would make a good basis for a solid sculpture, giving you a ready made base for clay or other material.
					<br>
					</p>
					<p>Here's an inset of one of the svg images produced by EarthSlicer:</p>

					<h2><a href="https://github.com/brucecooner/FLTTopo" target="_blank">FLT to topo</a></h2>
					<span class="codeTypeClass">C#</span>
					<p>
					After acquiring a laser cutter years ago, I wanted to make topographically inspired maps.
					For this to work I needed contour maps with the isolines at arbitrary elevations that weren't necessarily powers of ten.<br>
					I found out that I could download FLT/HDR format height maps from the USGS, so I wrote an application that could
					produce my arbitrarily contoured from these source files. I enjoyed breaking the problem down into smaller chunks of
					functionality, but my favorite part of this experience was using parallelism to massively decrease the time required to 
					create the output data.<br>
					While this program did what I intended it to do, unfortunately I found working contour maps in physical form to be unwieldy
					due to the large number of individual pieces the process produced.  Also, being forced to work with downloaded data which
					was broken on one degree boundaries quickly became limiting.  
					So I abandoned this project, and started the Earth Slicer project to make working with topographical data easiser.<br>
					Below are a couple of output images produced by the FLTTopo program.

					<span class="codeTypeClass">HTML/Javascript</span>
					<p>I had so much fun playing with the spokes maker that I created a drawing app completely focused on radial symmetry.<br>
					With it you draw lines (straight or freeform), circles, or curves onto a bunch of radial slices of a canvas, and you can 
					increase the number of to draw a whole lot of elements in a hurry.<br>
					I had more things in mind for this project but I got distracted and set it aside. It still wound up as something that's
					a lot of fun to play with though.<br>
					It's purely javascript, running in the browser, making extensive use of vector graphics.<br>
					Aspects of this project I particularly enjoyed were using object oriented design and classes to support the different drawing modes through a 
					common interface, and figuring out how to create the snap-to system.<br>

					<h2><a href="circles\circle_layout.html" target="_blank">parametric circles</a></h2>
					<span class="codeTypeClass">HTML/Javascript</span>
					<p>I was pretty obsessed with radial symmetry for a while, and made yet another toy along that theme.<br>
					This one however focused on laying out a bunch of circles along a set of spokes, with parametric controls to change
					the layout dynamically.
					Again, I had more ideas for this project but got distracted. I was planning to expand the number of element types beyond
					just circles, and it obviously needed a lot more instruction and feedback for ease of use.
					This is another javascript project that runs in the browser. I made sure this project can export to svg format.
					One unexpectedly fun aspect of this one was creating a color selection wheel for changing the stroke/fill colors.  It was not
					easy to accomplish but a lot of fun.
					Being parametric in nature, I was also able to add save/restore feature through local browser storage, which is pretty neat.<br>
					I did actually use this tool to export some circular art that went into a physical product made on my laser cutter.<br>

					<h2><a href="https://github.com/brucecooner/brucecooner.github.io" target="_blank">this website</a></h2>
					<span class="codeTypeClass">HTML/CSS/Javascript</span>
					<p>I wrote this website.<br>
					I found out that github hosts static sites freely for a user account, and decided that this is where I'd park one.<br>
					But it was also an exercise in creating a website from raw HTML without the use of frameworks (maybe some jquery).<br>
					After deciding on a three column layout, I originally implemented it in flex. This was difficult but worked okay. 
					Recently however I've gone back and refactored it to use grid layout, which does present a simpler way to achieve overall layouts
					(though flex still has its place).<br>
					Do not assume, however, that I'm sort of layout wizard. I still have to look up about anything new or different I
					go to do in html, and the interactions of CSS' various attributes is still largely a mystery to me.</p>

					<p>I was working on physical projects where there was a constant need to print out a template with N radially arranged

					So I made this quick little spoke generator.
					The fun part here was using only html and CSS to generate simple graphics.<br>

					<h2><a href="https://github.com/brucecooner/GF_scrapers" target="_blank">Glowforge dashboard job scraper</a></h2>
					<span class="codeTypeClass">Javascript</span>
					<p>
					If you've owned a Glowforge laser cutter for any length of time, you know that the dashboard where you select a print job
					will eventually become a huge list dozens of pages long.<br>
					For the longest time, the dashboard offered no way to search this list, which led to endless scrolling to find anything
					you'd printed more than a few weeks before.<br>
					Each of these print jobs has a unique url, meaning you can visit them directly if you have the address, which gave me an idea...<br>
					<br>
					My reponse was to create a javascript module that you add to the dashboard page (via the browser debug console) which
					hooks the scroll event and scrapes jobs and their urls as you scroll the page.<br>
					After scrolling through your job list, you return to the debugger and call a function in the module to
					list all of the jobs it has discovered in a tabular form, that you can drop directly into a spreadsheet.<br>
					I will regularly scrape all of the jobs in my dashboard and drop it into a sheet so Ihave a full and fully visible
					searchable list of all my print jobs.<br>
					Glowforge recently added a search bar to the dashboard, which helps, but it's still useful to have a single page view
					of my jobs list at times.

				<h2>Woodworking</h2>
				<p>I've been a hobbyist level woodworker since I was young enough to wield a pull saw.<br>
				It's a skill that has served me well, letting me create a lot of interesting and useful things.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Many years ago a coworker wanted a driving simulator cockpit that exactly matched the dimensions of his BMW's driver's seat, 
				to which he could mount a very expensive steering wheel controller he had recently acquired, and he asked me to help make it a reality. 
				The constraints made this a challenging and interesting project, and the result was a beautiful
				piece of functional entertainment focused furniture which, as far as I know, still resides in the middle of his living room.</p>

				<hr>
				<p>My wife requested a small three level shelf for her office space, and I took the opportunity to use a design I came
				up with some time ago that I call the "K Leg", where the front legs become an X with the cross pushed back, so that
				viewed from the side they form the shape of the letter K. I love the cantilever effect this lent to the middle shelf,
				and it was very practical on this design as it makes the center shelf easier to use.</p>

				<h2>Laser Cutting/Engraving</h2>
				<br>
				<p>For the past few years, a Glowforge laser cutter has been the focus of most of my creative activities.<br>
				Part of the reason I got a laser cutter was to make laser cut wooden models. Before I could do that, however, I
				had to learn some 3-d modeling skills. 
				Once I was slightly proficient in Fusion I designed this cute little stubby rocket model.</p><br>

				<a href=".\assets\stubby-rocket.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="assets\stubby-rocket.jpg" width="150"/></a>

				<p>I've always been fascinated by zeppelins, and soon I was making small models of the LZ-127 Graf Zeppelin.<br>
				My first zeppelin model was only about a foot in length.<br>
				Clicking the image will take you to a page with instructions and downloads for the model:<br></p>
				<a href=".\LZ127\LZ127-notes.html" target="_blank"><img src="LZ127\LZ127-completed.jpg" width="300"/></a>

				<p>I soon had designed a larger one, however, that required more complicated assembly.</p>

				TODO: medium zeppelin picture

				<p>And then I bumped up the size again, to product a 48 inch long model.</p>
